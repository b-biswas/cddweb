<strong>Théo Briolet</strong>, “Experimental study of microstructural controls on the weathering of carbonate rocks” <br>
Abstract : Interactions between water and carbonate rocks are involved in various issues such as CO2 storage, karst development and coastal weathering. A better understanding of the influence of pore structure on the weathering of carbonate rocks remains a key issue. An integrated multiscale experimental workflow was thus developed to study microstructural controls on the dissolution processes. Two different carbonate formations have been considered in this study. Although their mineralogy is similar, their microstructure is significantly different. Coreflooding experiments where CO2-saturated water was injected at a flowrate of 140 cm3/h for 5 days were carried out on 80-mm and 100-mm long samples. Chemical concentrations of dissolved species in the effluents were determined and thermodynamic modelling was used to estimate the outlet fluid saturation indexes. Samples petrophysical and petroacoustic properties were measured before and after coreflooding experiments. These measurements were completed by scanner and microscanner imaging, SEM observation and BET analysis. The dissolution patterns of Lavoux limestone are dominated by the development of localized dissolution channels ("wormholes"). Although the dissolution of Euville limestone appears more diffuse, microtomography has highlighted a preferential dissolution localized in specific more microporous areas. Microstructural characterizations based on BET analysis and SEM observations, combined with mini-coreflooding experiments performed on limestone powder, show that the higher dissolution kinetics of Lavoux limestone is mainly related to a larger specific surface area leading to a higher reactivity. Moreover, BET measurements revealed similar specific surface areas for the bulk rock and powder samples suggesting that most of the specific surface area is held at the microporous grain scale.<br>
<strong>Kun Zheng</strong>, “Selective leaching of indium from end-of-life LCD panels by desferrioxamine E”<br>
Abstract : The increasing consumption of electrical and electronic equipment has made recycling from end-of-life (EoL) products a key strategy for the stable supply of technology-critical elements and the development of a circular economy as proposed by the European Union (EU). The sustainable supply of indium, which is listed as a critical raw material by EU commission, is a major concern due to its high economic value. As one of major electronic waste (e-waste), liquid crystal display (LCD) panels are a potential resource for indium recovery because the indium-tin oxide layer in the LCD panels contains 80-90 wt% In2O3. Aimed to recycle indium from EoL LCD panels, biohydrometallurgy is environmentally benign as it does not involve highly acidic or alkali as well as toxic chemicals, consumes less energy and is more suitable to extract valuable metals as compared to conventional chemical hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy. Here, we develop an innovative and alternative technology to selectively leach indium from EoL LCD panels using Desferrioxamine E (DFOE), a natural chelator-siderophore, which has a less environmental impact compared with chemical synthesized compounds. Furthermore, DFOE exhibits a strong ability to bind indium, meanwhile, the metal complex resulting from the bioleaching has a high stability constant. The indium in the LCD panels first concentrated by a pre-treatment, including dismantling, removing polarizers, crushing, milling and sieving to obtain different size fractions. Characterization of LCD panels was analyzed by scanning electron microscope, X-ray fluorescence, and ICP-MS. The optimal conditions and the best capacity of leaching were determined by analyzing the influence of various parameters, including pH, pulp density, particle size, and the concentration of DFOE. The results showed that at neutral pH and 5 g/L of pulp density, for the smaller particle (<36 μm) with a high DFOE/EoL ratio (i.e. r = 20) corresponded to the highest leaching capacity. <br>
<strong>Jani Kastikainen</strong>, “Investigations of quantum critical systems”<br>
Abstract : In this talk, I will describe some aspects of my research on two-dimensional conformal field theories with boundaries. Conformal field theories are examples of quantum field theories that provide effective continuum descriptions of quantum many-body systems near a critical point. When the system has a boundary (a wall or a mirror), its entanglement and correlation properties are affected. After giving a brief introduction to the subject, I will show how entanglement entropies of subsystems and correlation functions of field operators are affected by the boundary. Some parts of my work utilise the relationship between quantum field theory and gravity known as the holographic duality which I might explain depending on time constraints. <br>

<strong>Lukas Maderer</strong>, “Measuring the Earth’s density profile with atmospheric neutrinos” <br>
Abstract : The Earth’s interior has been investigated for centuries to find out its inner structure. By analyzing the propagation of seismic waves one found that our planet consist of an Iron core surrounded by a pyrolytic mantle. Density models like PREM provide an approximate one-dimensional profile of Earth. Yet many theories like core-mantle convections highly depend on exact knowledge of certain densities. In this contribution a novel technique that could improve the understanding of the inner structure of the Earth with atmospheric neutrinos is presented.
In particle showers triggered by comsic rays interacting with atoms in the atmosphere, high energetic neutrinos are produced continuously. During their propagation through Earth, they undergo so called neutrino oscillations, meaning they change their flavor eigenstate. The probability for this phenomenon to occur depends among others on the electron density along the neutrino path. Neutrino detectors are able to measure the flavor ratio of the detected particles and consequently draw conclusions about the Earths density.
Here it is shown what limits can be set on the density of certain Earth layers, for both existing detectors and possible future experiments. I also report the possibility to investigate properties of LLSVPs, disturbances in the shear wave velocity that are believed to origin from density anomalies in the lower mantle. <br>
<strong>Xiaoquan Qin</strong>, “Geochemistry of trace metals associated with Fe-Mn nodules (FMN) of red soil 
profiles in China” <br>
Abstract : Red soil is widespread in southern China, covering an area of about 22.7% of China’s area. It has experienced intense syndepositional pedogenesis under humid tropical to subtropical conditions. In such soil profile, Fe and Mn oxides are omnipresent and frequently occur in Fe-Mn nodules of varying morphology, size, and shape. Due to their high surface area and high surface charge density, Fe and Mn oxides play crucial roles in concentrating and immobilizing trace metals in red soils. On the other side, Fe-Mn nodules are very sensitive to soil environmental changes, such as moisture, pH, redox potential, and microbial activity. Trace metals may be released due to organic fertilization of the soil or long-term saturation with water, leading to contamination of the soil as well as the soil solution and groundwater. Therefore, study on the geochemical behavior of trace metals associated with Fe-Mn nodule in red soil profile could help with improving our knowledge of trace metal cycling and their potential risk in such soil system, and also elucidating soil environmental changing which was recorded by nodules. <br>
<strong>Tri Dung Nguyen</strong>, “Photometric modeling for the characterization of planetary surfaces” <br>
Abstract : Photometry, which exploits the signal obtained from multi-angular and multi-spectral remote sensing data, is very important in planetary science because it is often the only source of information about the Solar System bodies. The behavior of light on the surface is recorded as the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). The combination of radiometric data acquired at several scales, phase angles and wavelengths will allow to access the physical properties of the surface. We will focus on the determination of the BRDF of the surface of the Earth (Asal-Ghoubbet rift, Republic of Djibouti) and of the Moon. To conduct this research, data from various instruments are actively gathered: laboratory and field goniometers, drones and satellites (Pleiades, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter…). We will then use these data with radiative transfer models to extract soil physical properties: surface roughness, porosity, grain size and shape, particle size distribution, micro-texture, mineralogy, water content, etc. They are the keys to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of soils and landscapes, and contribute to the preparation of future space missions (rover mobility, landing). During my talk, I will detail about the scope of my research. I will also present the state of progress of my work and what remains to be done in the near future. <br>
<strong>Runa van Tent</strong>,“Global mantle density tomography using Earth’s free oscillations” <br>
Abstract : Constraints on the 3-D density structure of Earth’s mantle provide important insights into the nature of global-scale mantle convection. Two regions of particular interest are the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle under Africa and the Pacific, which may be rising (super-)plumes or dense, stable piles. The only seismic data directly sensitive to density variations throughout the entire mantle are normal modes: whole Earth oscillations that are observed after large earthquakes. However, their sensitivity to density is weak compared to the sensitivity to seismic velocity and previous studies have presented conflicting density models of the lower mantle, showing either entirely light or entirely dense LLSVPs. Here, we present our new models of 3-D mantle velocity, density and discontinuity topography, obtained from the inversion of recent normal-mode measurements using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, which also provides us with model uncertainties. We find a large high-density region in the bottom-300 km of both LLSVPs, while the remaining LLSVP material has a lower-than-average density. These partially dense LLSVPs imply that they are at least partially compositionally distinct, as temperature variations alone cannot decorrelate seismic velocity and density. Furthermore, we compare our density model to the density structure obtained from a range of models of thermochemical convection and assess whether our density model can distinguish between different thermochemical scenarios. <br>

<strong>Emilie Pirot</strong>, “Exploring Greenland seismicity with Machine Learning” <br>
Abstract : Greenland and polar regions in general are highly sensitive to global warming. Impacts on Greenland’s glaciers may be observed through the increasing number of calving events. 
To better understand this impact, it’s important to be able to quantify and document the calving activity. However, direct observations are impossible to perform recurrently over long-time period because of the weather and of the lack of human witnesses. 
The deployment of a seismological network in Greenland has able the recording at regional scales of seismic signals generated by calving events, which are called glacial earthquakes.
The seismic signal generated by calving events presents a broadband frequency range and a wide
diversity of waveform which make them difficult to discriminate from tectonic events as well as anthropogenic and natural noises.
Starting from two catalogs of known events, one for glacial earthquake events which occurred between 1993 and 2013 and one for earthquakes which occurred in the same time period, we trained and tested a detection algorithm based on the STA/LTA method to extract signals’ events from continuous data. 
Then, a machine learning processing chain allows the signal’s quick automatic classification onto different classes : glacial earthquakes, earthquake and noise, with the probability of belonging to this class. Signals are gathered to form events, which increase the algorithm’s accuracy. We here present a catalog of new seismic events, identified with our method.
The algorithm performances are tied with the choice of parameters. We will thus discuss the importance of features chosen to describe glacial earthquake seismic signals and analyze how the contribution of machine learning can step up the understanding of glacial earthquakes events.
We investigated a 400 days spanning time of continuous data from the Greenland regional seismic network and identified new glacial earthquakes events with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to create a catalog. This processing chain will be deployed on other time period to expand our catalog. <br>
<strong>Alice Dupiau</strong>, “Modeling spectral and directional soil reflectance in the solar domain (400-2500 nm) 
as a function of moisture content” <br>
Abstract : Soil moisture content (SMC) plays a key role in the interactions between land surfaces and the atmosphere. Its estimation is essential for applications such as agriculture, hydrology, climate, or defense. Since the 1970s, remote sensing has emerged as a promising tool for mapping SMC over large areas. Different wavelength ranges can be used: solar (0.3-3 µm), thermal infrared (3-12 µm), and microwave (0.5-100 cm). The longer the wavelength, the deeper the water can be probed. In the solar domain, light penetrates very little into the soil because it is quickly absorbed: SMC is estimated over a maximum depth of about one millimeter.
MARMIT-2 (Dupiau et al. 2022. Remote Sens. Environ.) is a two-layer radiative transfer model that depicts a wet soil as a dry soil topped with a thin layer of a mixture of water and soil particles. The reflectance spectrum of wet soil is expressed as a function of the reflectance spectrum of the corresponding dry soil and four input parameters: a fixed one, the complex refractive index of soil particles, and three free ones, the thickness of the water layer, the surface fraction of wet soil, and the volume fraction of soil particles in the water layer. MARMIT-2 has been validated on a database of 225 soil samples whose reflectance spectra have been measured in the laboratory at various moisture contents. The work in progress consists in the extension of MARMIT-2 to larger spatial scale for its operational use in remote sensing. <br>
<strong>Baptiste Thomas</strong>, “Caracterising convective mixing efficiency in a terrestrial magma ocean” <br>
Abstract : Geochemical heterogeneities formed at the very beginning of the Earth's history are found in modern oceanic basalt samples. Such observations raise many questions, including the efficiency of mixing in the Earth's mantle. 
However, during the first hundred million years, likely as a result of the Moon-forming giant impact, the Earth experienced a magma ocean episode over the entirety, or a large part, of the thickness of the mantle.
A quantitative understanding of mixing in the magma ocean is then key to interpreting geochemical observations of very short-lived isotopes.
In our work, we use 3D numerical simulations in a spherical shell to study convection and quantify the efficiency of mixing processes in a magma ocean.
Due to the low viscosity of the magma ocean we take into account inertial effects, and also examine the effects of rotation. Our simulations couple convection with a study of Lyapunov exponents to quantify mixing. <br>

<strong>Angèle Laurent</strong>, “Source Characterisation of the Very Long Period Earthquakes of the Mayotte 
ongoing Seismo-Volcanic Crisis” <br>
Abstract : VLF (Very Low Frequency) events of the ongoing seismovolcanic crisis of Mayotte detected through a single-station time-frequency detector with data that comes from local and regional stations in Mayotte, Comoros and Madagascar. We incorporate OBH (Ocean Bottom Hydrophones) data installed during marine campaigns aboard the R/V Marion Dufresne II, between May and July 2019 [Feuillet et al., 2019], and shorter campaigns since July 2019. The correction of the OBH pressure data into acceleration [An et al., 2017] allow us to perform analysis like location and modelling and observe the complexity of the source mechanism in the VLFs signal at local scale. Event location is performed though spatial 3D back-projection of station-pair cross-correlation functions [Poiata et al., 2016], assuming a velocity of 3.5 km/s.
While the VLF epicentral location is reasonably well constrained 20 km east of Petite-Terre by the back-projection analysis, depth resolution is poor. For this reason, we explore VLF depth and focal mechanism from direct modelling of the signal at local scale using discrete wavenumber summation [Cotton and Coutant, 1997]. Synthetic seismograms generated using a simple 1D model and an isotropic focal mechanism provide a good ct with the observed signals. We found that VLFs are located above 25 km of depth, on the top of the seismic swarm, east of Petite-Terre. We further explore the spatio-temporal link between the VLFs and the volcano-tectonic seismicity and the possible source models for VLFs. <br>
<strong>Raphaël Bajou</strong>, “Assessing rock strength distribution in lava dome with muon tomography” <br>
Abstract : The intense hydrothermal activity occurring at La Soufrière de Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles, is a major concern for both volcanologists at the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Guadeloupe and for the local population living nearby. Partly hosted within the andesitic lava dome, this hydrothermal system, continuously fueled with meteoric waters, is indeed responsible for both violent phreatic eruptions (the last major event occurred in 1976-1977), and fast rock alteration due to hot and acid fluid circulation that worsens the risk of a partial volcano flank collapse. 
Since 2015, the deployment of scintillator-based particle trackers built in IP2I, Lyon, to perform dynamic muon tomography of the lava dome structure has allowed to increase the knowledge of the hydrothermal activity. 
The method is similar to X-ray radiography, where the particles are absorbed according to the mass density distribution along the traveled path. Muon tomography involves performing a radiography of a geological body of large dimensions by using a single detector.
Here we will present new results obtained with data acquired with the last generation of those detectors installed in south and east of the volcano to scan different areas of the lava dome. The results obtained with real data  were put in comparison with simulation studies, allowing a better characterization of the muon signal/background, which will further improve the quality of the dome 3D density reconstruction. <br>
<strong>Marie Vulliet</strong>, “Erosional dynamics of a river driven by groundwater seepage” <br>
Abstract : Seepage erosion occurs when groundwater emerges at the surface of a granular heap. A spring forms and feeds a river which entrains sediments, thus changing the groundwater flow. We reproduce this phenomenon in the laboratory using a quasi-2D aquifer filled with glass beads, by imposing a water level at one end of the pile. Water flows through the aquifer and emerges at the surface of the granular bed. For large enough water levels this river erodes its bed and the spring progressively ascends the heap. We investigate its trajectory, the evolution of the groundwater discharge and the river depth. Intriguingly, we find that after an initial erosive period the river attains a new equilibrium profile, with an elevated spring. We model the flow in the aquifer using Darcy's law, predicting the shape of the water table, the position of the spring and the groundwater discharge. By applying Coulomb’s frictional law to the forces experienced by a grain we predict a threshold for the onset of erosion as a function of reservoir height and aquifer length. This prediction provides a dynamical theory for the erosional dynamics of the river. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach thereby helps constrain the response of an idealized erosive river-catchment system to steady forcing. <br>
